## The Man, The Myth, THE LEGEND >:D

Khoi, alias Fran Online is derived from both my name and the game RAN-ONLINE, my earliest exposure to video game culture.  
A common myth is im a serious ahh, clearly i'm not  
The Legend is a fish that can be caught during Spring in the Mountain lake during rainy weather. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.

## AI added this segment so here's the games i play i guess

- **Minecraft** – for endless creativity (actually one of my earliest exposure to game dev, /execute @e[type = pig] ~ ~ ~ summon lightning)  
- **Stardew Valley** – relaxing pixel farming (relaxing? jades, staircase, reach floor 300, monster musk + napalm-burglar = watch the assault)  
- **Genshin Impact** & **Honkai Star Rail** – immersive worlds & stories (gambling go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr)  
- **Mobile Legends** – fast-paced competition (character lore is as disposable as the fanbase)  
- **Pokémon** – catching, training, and battling since childhood! (i know all 1025 and counting, fight me)

## 🌟 Projects

Play both Unlit (Light-Based Rage Game) and Raniag! (Light-Inspired Game Jam entry) on my Itch.io page >:D https://franaxus.itch.io/

Currently working on 
- **OFAF: Fall of Isla Renia**: A part of the "Of Fibs and Farces" Series where every character is represented by a form or medium of Obfuscating the Truth, a Game Deeply rooted in the Psychology of Lying and the behaviors and notions that surround each one  

- **The Last Coffee, For You**: you are 28 days away from dying, and you decided to go around town and reconnect with friends old and new, former partners, people you strayed from due to miscommunication, and various other personalities, in hopes of leaving with no regrets,  
at the 29th day you get to see how many people stayed with you in the end..  
it's time to reflect on the life you lived

- **One for the Dreamer**: You're right, this one is about me ^ ^, sometimes i just gotta make one for the DREAMER who wishes for change, One for the ARCHON who wants to reign low and one for the FOREIGN who yearns to belong...  
A love letter to old game ideas and to myself, Dreamer, Foreign and Archon are characters that comes from the etymology of my full name (you can look it up if yk my name) and i put it in relation to myself  
Greet me a Happy 20th Birthday Profile Reader :> (specially if kumokopya kayo ng labs saken)
